For example, you could include traditional Chinese herbal medicine ingredients or plants in the background, such as ginseng or goji berries, to emphasize the connection to herbal medicine. Additionally, incorporating comic book-style speech bubbles or sound effects could further enhance the retro comic book aesthetic. Another idea could be to include characters or symbols from Chinese folklore or mythology, blending traditional cultural elements with the comic book style. These additions would help to create a more immersive and cohesive fusion between the two themes.',\n",
